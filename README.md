MaximoApp
=========

The Maximo demo highlights how BIRT can be used with existing Maximo installations.  The demo collects data from Maximo and combines that with data from other sources (database) to provide meaningful and actionable dashboards. The audience would be anybody interested in seeing how Maximo data could be used to provide additional reporting/dashboarding functionality than what Maximo provides and/or has the requirement to combine data from multiple sources.  A main benefit is that it provides this without the requirement of a Maximo license.

Integration with Metrics Management.  Integration with Google Maps. Viewing Maximo data without requiring a Maximo license.
